LAB REPORT 3

*Part 1 : BUGS*



*Part 2 : Researching Commands*


*ChatGPT Inputs and Outputs* 
I provided ChatGPT with the buggy code and then asked it to provide 
- a failure inducing input as Junit test
- an input that doesn't induce a failure
- the bug as before and after code change required to fix it
- brifely describe why the fix addresses the issue

Output: ChatGPT gave me several code blocks addressing each issue
specifically but I copied the code onto TextEdit then screenshotted
each and uploaded the files onto Github to paste into this lab
for part 1 (BUGS).

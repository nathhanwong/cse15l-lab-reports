The fix addresses the issue because it ensures that the 'getFiles' method
works correctly not only for the the directory inputs but also the file 
inputs. It correctly lists all the files in the given subdirectories as 
well as the directories.



*Part 2 : Researching Commands*








*ChatGPT Inputs and Outputs* 
I provided ChatGPT with the buggy code and then asked it to provide 
- a failure inducing input as Junit test
- an input that doesn't induce a failure
- the bug as before and after code change required to fix it
- brifely describe why the fix addresses the issue

Output: 
- ChatGPT gave me several code blocks addressing each issue
specifically but I copied the code onto TextEdit then screenshotted
each and uploaded the files onto Github to paste into this lab
for part 1 (BUGS).
